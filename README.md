# Homelab: System and Network Administration Projects

## Windows Server and Desktop Administration Lab 

**I chose to use VMware Workstation as it allows nested virtualization which was needed for the ESXi hosts.**

Using VMware Workstation, ESXi, vSphere, and vCenter, I built a virtual Windows domain lab environment that allows me to gain experience using VMware infrastructure to deploy services common in Windows environments. I also use pfSense, a free open source firewall and router to create a closed network 
- Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, WDS, WSUS, NTFS Permissions, Network File Shares, Powershell
- Using pfSense for switching, routing, isolating traffic between servers, clients, and external networks.
